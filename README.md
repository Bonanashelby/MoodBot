# MoodBot
## Python 401 Midterm Week Project

# Project Description:
*Our project's goal is to create a web application that processes text given by a user to determine the users current emotional state. Based off of the text excerpt written by the user MoodBot will then be able to provide the user with suggestions to continue that mood or how to change it. Going along with our idea we would like to implement some stretch goals that would allow us to process data from sites like Twitter or Reddit to see the emotional hisotry of that site. In the case of a Twitter user, MoodBot would be able to give a month to month report of the emotional data based off of the users tweet history. That is what our project is aiming to accomplish.*
## MVP:
* Take user input and output a response
* sentiment language processing 
* Be able to give options back to the use based off of users emotions data 
* front facing web abb that takes input, parses that data and responds with suggestions. 
## Stretch Goals:
* Twitter data analytics
* Reddit (subreddits) data analytics
* Show users history - month to month, happiest tweet/saddest tweet, graph the data to show the analysis
